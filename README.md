## Project Name

### Autocomplete twitter-ish

Autocomplete function, just like Twitter. It detects when user inserts an @ and then [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/building-search-ui/what-is-instantsearch/react-hooks/)'s algorithm starts a search. After that, user can select the account that is going to be mentioned and the application will insert this account name into the text area input.

## Reflection

- This project was made following [Midudev](https://github.com/midudev)'s video on his [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPsJbwUaaOo) channel.
- His video showed the way to implement the feature using JS, while in this project I used TS.
- The next step that I intend to do, is to make the user able to move trough the list with the keyboards key (arrow up/down), and then select the user with enter key.
